Despite having almost limitless reserves of oil, the kingdom is embracing solar and wind power, partly in an effort to retain a leading position in the energy industry, which is vitally important to the country but fast changing. Looking out over 3.3 million panels, covering 14 square miles of desert, Faisal Al Omari, chief executive of a recently completed solar project called Sudair, said he would tell his children and grandchildren about contributing to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs energy transition. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really proud to be part of it,‚Äù he said. Although petroleum production retains a crucial role in the Saudi economy, the kingdom is putting its chips on other forms of energy. Sudair, which can light up 185,000 homes, is the first of what could be many giant projects intended to raise output from renewable energy sources like solar and wind to around 50 percent by 2030. Currently, renewable energy accounts for a negligible amount of Saudi electricity generation. Analysts say achieving that hugely ambitious goal is unlikely. ‚ÄúIf they get 30 percent, I would be happy because that would be a good signal,‚Äù said Karim Elgendy, a climate analyst at the Middle East Institute, a research organization in Washington. Still, the kingdom is planning to build solar farms at a rapid pace. ‚ÄúThe volumes you see here, you don‚Äôt see anywhere else, only in China,‚Äù said Marco Arcelli, chief executive of Acwa Power, Sudair‚Äôs Saudi developer and a growing force in the international electricity and water industries.

Looking out over 3.3 million panels, covering 14 square miles of desert, Faisal Al Omari, chief executive of a recently completed solar project called Sudair, said he would tell his children and grandchildren about contributing to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs energy transition. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really proud to be part of it,‚Äù he said. Although petroleum production retains a crucial role in the Saudi economy, the kingdom is putting its chips on other forms of energy. Sudair, which can light up 185,000 homes, is the first of what could be many giant projects intended to raise output from renewable energy sources like solar and wind to around 50 percent by 2030. Currently, renewable energy accounts for a negligible amount of Saudi electricity generation. Analysts say achieving that hugely ambitious goal is unlikely. ‚ÄúIf they get 30 percent, I would be happy because that would be a good signal,‚Äù said Karim Elgendy, a climate analyst at the Middle East Institute, a research organization in Washington. Still, the kingdom is planning to build solar farms at a rapid pace. ‚ÄúThe volumes you see here, you don‚Äôt see anywhere else, only in China,‚Äù said Marco Arcelli, chief executive of Acwa Power, Sudair‚Äôs Saudi developer and a growing force in the international electricity and water industries.

ByRoger Cohen Reporting from Paris There will be no French fries for the 15,000 athletes at the Olympic Games that open in France in July. Yes, you read that right. In what is being called the biggest restaurant in the world ‚Äî a 700-foot-long former electrical power plant at the heart of the Olympic Village ‚Äî there will be no foie gras, either, but vegetarian hot dogs and quinoa muesli will abound. Strolling the length of what is known as the nave, a light-filled vaulted space where some 45,000 meals a day will be served 24/7 throughout the Olympics and Paralympics, St√©phane Chicheri and Charles Guilloy, the chefs in charge, sang the praises of vegetarian shawarma, za‚Äôatar-spiced sweet potatoes with hummus, cabbage pickles, beetroot falafel and grilled eggplant with smoked paprika. This is a far cry from the classic French cuisine of elaborate sauces and ‚Äúenough melted butter to thrombose a regiment,‚Äù as A.J. Liebling oncedescribed a dish. But these are 21st-century Games on a warming planet. Carbon imprint trumps cassoulet. Vegetable protein is the thing; and of course athletes have to perform in a country of a thousand epicurean delights that are no-noes to their exacting nutritionists.

For more than two years, a group of health experts, economists and lawyers in the U.S. government has worked to address a growing public health crisis: people dying on the job from extreme heat. In the coming months, this team of roughly 30 people at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to propose a new rule that would require employers to protect an estimated 50 million people exposed to high temperatures while they work. They includefarm laborers and construction workers, but also people who sort packages in warehouses, clean airplane cabins and cook in commercial kitchens. The measure would be the first major federal government regulation to protect Americans from heat on the job. And it is expected to meet stiff resistance from some business and industry groups, which oppose regulations that would, in some cases, require more breaks and access to water, shade and air-conditioning. But even if the rule takes effect, experts say, the government‚Äôs emergency response system is poorly suited to meet the urgency of the moment.

In the coming months, this team of roughly 30 people at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to propose a new rule that would require employers to protect an estimated 50 million people exposed to high temperatures while they work. They includefarm laborers and construction workers, but also people who sort packages in warehouses, clean airplane cabins and cook in commercial kitchens. The measure would be the first major federal government regulation to protect Americans from heat on the job. And it is expected to meet stiff resistance from some business and industry groups, which oppose regulations that would, in some cases, require more breaks and access to water, shade and air-conditioning. But even if the rule takes effect, experts say, the government‚Äôs emergency response system is poorly suited to meet the urgency of the moment. Last year was the hottest in recorded history, and researchers are expecting another record-breaking summer, with temperatures already rising sharply across the Sun Belt. The heat index in Miamireached 112 degrees Fahrenheitlast weekend, shattering daily records by 11 degrees. The surge in deaths from heat is now the greatest threat to human health posed by climate change, said Dr. John M. Balbus, the deputy assistant secretary for climate change and health equity in the Health and Human Services Department. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Used for decades in countless everyday objects ‚Äî cosmetics, takeout containers, frying pans ‚Äî PFAS have been linked to serious health risks including cancer. Last month the federal government said several types of PFAS must beremoved from the drinking water of hundreds of millions of Americans. ‚ÄúDo what you can, while you can, before you get sued,‚Äù Mr. Gross said at the February session, according to a recording of the event made by a participant and examined by The New York Times. ‚ÄúReview any marketing materials or other communications that you‚Äôve had with your customers, with your suppliers, see whether there‚Äôs anything in those documents that‚Äôs problematic to your defense,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWeed out people and find the right witness to represent your company.‚Äù A spokesman for Mr. Gross‚Äôs employer, MG+M The Law Firm, which defends companies in high-stakes litigation, didn‚Äôt respond to questions about Mr. Gross‚Äôs remarks and said he was unavailable to discuss them. A wide swath of the chemicals, plastics and related industries are gearing up to fight a surge in litigation related to PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a class of nearly 15,000 versatile synthetic chemicals linked to serious health problems. PFAS chemicals have been detected almost everywhere scientists have looked: in drinking water, inrain falling over the Great Lakes, even inAntarctic snow. They are thought to bepresent in the blood of nearly every American. Researchers have linked exposure to PFAS to testicular and kidney cancers, developmental delays in children, decreased fertility, liver damage and thyroid disease. The man-made chemicals are so long-lasting that scientists haven‚Äôt been able to reliably identify how long it might take for them to break down.

ByHiroko Tabuchi The defense lawyer minced no words as he addressed a room full of plastic-industry executives. Prepare for a wave of lawsuits‚Äã with‚Äã potentially ‚Äúastronomical‚Äù costs‚Äã. Speaking at a conference earlier this year, the lawyer, Brian Gross, said the coming litigation could ‚Äúdwarf anything related to asbestos,‚Äù one of the most sprawling corporate-liability battles in United States history. Mr. Gross was referring to PFAS, the‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äùthat have emerged as one of the major pollution issues of our time. Used for decades in countless everyday objects ‚Äî cosmetics, takeout containers, frying pans ‚Äî PFAS have been linked to serious health risks including cancer. Last month the federal government said several types of PFAS must beremoved from the drinking water of hundreds of millions of Americans. ‚ÄúDo what you can, while you can, before you get sued,‚Äù Mr. Gross said at the February session, according to a recording of the event made by a participant and examined by The New York Times. ‚ÄúReview any marketing materials or other communications that you‚Äôve had with your customers, with your suppliers, see whether there‚Äôs anything in those documents that‚Äôs problematic to your defense,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWeed out people and find the right witness to represent your company.‚Äù A spokesman for Mr. Gross‚Äôs employer, MG+M The Law Firm, which defends companies in high-stakes litigation, didn‚Äôt respond to questions about Mr. Gross‚Äôs remarks and said he was unavailable to discuss them. A wide swath of the chemicals, plastics and related industries are gearing up to fight a surge in litigation related to PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a class of nearly 15,000 versatile synthetic chemicals linked to serious health problems. PFAS chemicals have been detected almost everywhere scientists have looked: in drinking water, inrain falling over the Great Lakes, even inAntarctic snow. They are thought to bepresent in the blood of nearly every American. Researchers have linked exposure to PFAS to testicular and kidney cancers, developmental delays in children, decreased fertility, liver damage and thyroid disease. The man-made chemicals are so long-lasting that scientists haven‚Äôt been able to reliably identify how long it might take for them to break down.

ByBrad Plumer Reporting from Washington The Biden administration on Tuesdaylaid out for the first time a set of broad government guidelinesaround the use of carbon offsets in an attempt to shore up confidence in a method for tackling global warming that has faced growing criticism. Companies and individualsspent $1.7 billion last yearvoluntarily buying carbon offsets, which are intended to cancel out the climate effects of activities like air travel by funding projects elsewhere, such as the planting of trees, that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but that wouldn‚Äôt have happened without the extra money. Yet a growing number ofstudiesandreportshave found that many carbon offsetssimply don‚Äôt work. Some offsets help fund wind or solar projects that likely would have been built anyway. And it‚Äôs often extremely difficult to measure the effectiveness of offsets intended to protect forests. As a result, some scientists and researchers have argued that carbon offsets are irredeemably flawedand should be abandoned altogether. Instead, they say, companies should just focus on directly cutting their own emissions. The Biden administration is now weighing in on this debate, saying that offsets can sometimes be an important tool for helping businesses and others reduce their emissions, as long as there are guardrails in place. The new federal guidelines are an attempt to define ‚Äúhigh-integrity‚Äù offsets as those that deliver real and quantifiable emissions reductions that wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise taken place.

ByHilary Howard When congestion pricing takes effect in New York City next month, officials say it will create an array of benefits: The system‚Äôs tolls will generate revenue for improving mass transit while prompting some drivers to avoid Manhattan, potentially reducing traffic and air pollution, as well as carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. Some of those goals are already within sight: Devices that will monitor cars and send bills to drivers are in place, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which will operate the system, has begun to detail the transit repairs and upgrades it plans to spend its windfall on.

And some people worry that less air pollution in some areas will be offset by more in others, despite efforts to keep that from happening. According to anenvironmental assessmentby the authority, congestion pricing could decrease air pollution overall in three boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.

There are tremendous problems with this plan. Injunctive relief is needed here to stop what could be one of the most devastating policy decisions in New York State history.

ByHilary Howard When congestion pricing takes effect in New York City next month, officials say it will create an array of benefits: The system‚Äôs tolls will generate revenue for improving mass transit while prompting some drivers to avoid Manhattan, potentially reducing traffic and air pollution, as well as carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. Some of those goals are already within sight: Devices that will monitor cars and send bills to drivers are in place, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which will operate the system, has begun to detail the transit repairs and upgrades it plans to spend its windfall on. For now, though, it is unclear how much the program will contribute to New York State‚Äôs ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse emissions 85 percent by 2050. And some people worry that less air pollution in some areas will be offset by more in others, despite efforts to keep that from happening. According to anenvironmental assessmentby the authority, congestion pricing could decrease air pollution overall in three boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. The concern is that rerouted traffic could increase it in the Bronx and on Staten Island. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe to say the direct air-quality benefits would be modest but measurable overall,‚Äù said Eric A.

Trump is crystal clear about his disdain for electric vehicles. The former president has falsely claimed electric cars don‚Äôt work, promised to shred President Biden‚Äôs policies that encourage E.V. manufacturing and sales, and has said he would slap a ‚Äú100 percent tariff‚Äù on electric cars imported from Mexico if he retakes the White House. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to be able to sell those cars,‚Äùhe has said. But analysts say that even if Mr. Trump is elected and ends federal policies that support electric vehicles, by the time that happens, the market may have reached a level where it would keep growing without government help. A record 1.2 million Americans bought electric vehicles last year, making up 7.6 percent of new car sales and moving the cars and trucks from the margin to the mainstream of the American auto market.Analysts project that will climb to 10 percent this year, which researchers saycould signal a tipping pointfor rapid, widespread E.V. adoption. While a Trump presidency couldn‚Äôt slam the brakes on the E.V. transition, it could throw enough sand in the gears to slow it down. And that might have significant consequences for the fight to stop global warming. President Biden placed electric vehicles at the heart of his climate agenda because scientists say that a rapid switch from gasoline-powered cars to electric versions is one of the most effective ways to slow the carbon dioxide emissions that are dangerously heating the planet. Last year was the hottest in recorded history and scientists say the world is on track to heat up even more, to the point where parts of the planet will be unlivable.

And that might have significant consequences for the fight to stop global warming. President Biden placed electric vehicles at the heart of his climate agenda because scientists say that a rapid switch from gasoline-powered cars to electric versions is one of the most effective ways to slow the carbon dioxide emissions that are dangerously heating the planet.

But analysts say that even if Mr. Trump is elected and ends federal policies that support electric vehicles, by the time that happens, the market may have reached a level where it would keep growing without government help.

While a Trump presidency couldn‚Äôt slam the brakes on the E.V. transition, it could throw enough sand in the gears to slow it down. And that might have significant consequences for the fight to stop global warming. President Biden placed electric vehicles at the heart of his climate agenda because scientists say that a rapid switch from gasoline-powered cars to electric versions is one of the most effective ways to slow the carbon dioxide emissions that are dangerously heating the planet.
